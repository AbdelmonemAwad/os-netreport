# Build an installable OPNsense plugin package from this repository.
#
#   sh tools/make-package.sh [-o OUTDIR] [-c CATEGORY]
#
# It runs on the firewall, because the thing it builds is a FreeBSD package and pkg(8) is
# the only program that writes one. It does not need root and it installs nothing: the
# staging happens in a temporary directory that is removed on the way out, and the result
# is one .pkg file whose path and SHA256 you are told.
#
# WHAT THE MAKEFILE GIVES AND WHAT THIS HAS TO SUPPLY
#
# The Makefile carries PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_VERSION, PLUGIN_COMMENT, PLUGIN_MAINTAINER and
# PLUGIN_DEPENDS, and that is all it carries. Everything else in a package manifest comes
# from ../../Mk/plugins.mk inside the OPNsense plugins tree, which this repository is not
# in yet. So this script supplies, by hand:
#
#   origin        opnsense/os-<name>, the path the plugin will have in that tree
#   prefix        /usr/local
#   licence       BSD2CLAUSE, licenselogic single
#   www           PLUGIN_WWW, or this repository on GitHub
#   category      -c, or PLUGIN_CATEGORY, or misc (metadata only; see below)
#   abi/arch      FreeBSD:*:*, because src/ holds no compiled object; see below
#   deps          origin and version looked up with pkg, never guessed
#   annotations   the product_* set OPNsense reads
#
# and it writes the one file the hand installation never wrote: /usr/local/opnsense/
# version/<name>. Every OPNsense plugin ships one - it is in the file list of os-smart,
# os-vnstat and all the rest - and that file is what the framework reads when it is asked
# whether the plugin is installed:
#
#   opnsense-version -c linkhealth     # exit 0 if it is there, 1 if it is not
#
# The argument is the name of the marker file, which is PLUGIN_NAME - not os-linkhealth.
# opnsense-version takes the marker to read as its operand and defaults to "core", so
# "opnsense-version -c os-linkhealth" looks for a file this plugin does not ship, and
# answers "not installed" for a plugin that is installed.

# rebuilt when the release moves. A package built out of tree is not rebuilt by anybody,
# so a concrete ABI would write an expiry date into it for no reason: this plugin is PHP,
# Python, XML, Volt and JavaScript, and none of that is compiled against anything.
# FreeBSD:*:* says exactly that, and it is not a novelty - os-abuseipdb, a third-party
# OPNsense plugin, ships FreeBSD:*:* and installs and runs on this machine although it
# was built on FreeBSD 14.

# lose one in the path of an ordinary editing mistake, and both of them end in a package
# that builds, reports success and is wrong:
#
#   a file that contains a line equal to the terminator ends the string early, and its

#
#   a file whose last byte is not a newline carries the terminator onto its own last

#   script are swallowed into it. A package built that way installs with post-install
#   holding nothing that runs and post-deinstall absent altogether: configd is never
#   restarted, /var/db is never created, the plugin is never registered in config.xml,
